# Face-Recognition-using-a-ConvNet
This is a personal project from DeepLearning.AI's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) Course#4: Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository implements a face recognition system using a CNN architecture. It allows you to train the model on a labeled dataset and perform recognition on unseen images. This project tackles the challenge of recognizing faces using the power of deep learning!

Here's what this project allows you to do:
- Train a Face Recognizer: You'll provide a collection of images with labeled faces (think names or IDs). The system analyzes these images to learn the unique features of each person.
- See Who's There: Once trained, the system can identify faces in new images! Show it a picture of your family reunion, and it might tell you who everyone is!
