# Face Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks 🧠📸

This project implements a face recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Inspired by DeepLearning.AI's Deep Learning Specialization (Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks), it demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to identify individuals in images.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system is designed to:

- **Train a Face Recognizer**: Utilize a labeled dataset of facial images to learn distinctive features of each individual.
- **Identify Faces in New Images**: After training, accurately recognize and label faces in unseen images.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow** – Deep learning framework for model training and inference
- **Keras** – High-level API for building CNNs
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and face detection
